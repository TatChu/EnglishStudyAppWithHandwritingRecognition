								<p>Vietnamese mango salad (gỏi xoài) is a vibrant dish featuring green mangoes, shrimp, and is highlighted with fresh herbs like mint, thai basil and cilantro. It’s a mouth-watering combination of sweet, sour, salty with lots of contrasts in texture.</p>

								<p>Disclaimer: this is supposed to be a very simple salad. The one we’re making here has a bit of extras to make it fancier. But stripped down, you can just mix together mangoes, dried shrimp, cilantro and salad dressing.</p>
								<p>Also, there’s no fixed combo of herbs or veggies neither. Use whichever of these herbs you have on hand, add or don’t add cucumbers. Substitute bell peppers for the carrots for color. You get the picture.</p>
								<h2>Choosing Mangoes</h2>
								<p>Admittedly the mangoes I used here are obviously not “green”–and that’s okay! These are Kent mangoes and they appear yellow even when unripe. Kents are less fibrous, so a great choice for salad when they’re available in the summer.</p>
								<p>If you can’t find Kent, the other commonly available mango varieties from Mexico or Thailand will do just fine. There’s a common variety of mango available from India too. This one’s really green looking, more sour than the others (maybe you’re into that!) and is available year-round.</p>
								<p>In Vietnam, lots of mangos varieties are available for making salad with. One type is xoài tượng, weighing in at about 2-4 pounds and about the size of a papaya.</p>
